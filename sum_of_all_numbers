You are given an array of integers called '$numbers'. Write a PHP program to perform the following tasks:
 1. Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the array and store it in a variable called '$sum'. 
 2. Find the maximum value in the array and store it in a variable called '$max'. 
 3. Find the minimum value in the array and store it in a variable called '$min'.
 4. Calculate the average (mean) of all the numbers in the array and store it in a variable called '$average'. Round the average to two decimal places. 
 5. Create a new array called `$evenNumbers` that contains only the even numbers from the original array '$numbers'.
 6. Create a new array called `$oddNumbers` that contains only the odd numbers from the original array '$numbers'. Finally, print the values of '$sum', '$max', '$min', '$average', '$evenNumbers', and '$oddNumbers'. 
Code:
<?php
// user for take input  
echo "Enter the numbers with a comma: ";
$numbers = explode(",", trim(fgets(STDIN)));
$sum = 0;
foreach ($numbers as $number) {
  $sum += $number;
}

// Maximun number find
$max = $numbers[0];
foreach ($numbers as $number) {
  if ($number > $max) {
    $max = $number;
  }
}
 // minimum number find
$min = $numbers[0];
foreach ($numbers as $number) {
  if ($number < $min) {
    $min = $number;
  }
}

//  average find
$average = $sum / count($numbers);
$average = round($average, 2);

//  even numbers array find 
$evenNumbers = [];
foreach ($numbers as $number) {
  if ($number % 2 == 0) {
    $evenNumbers[] = $number;
  }
}

//  odd numbers array find 
$oddNumbers = [];
foreach ($numbers as $number) {
  if ($number % 2 != 0) {
    $oddNumbers[] = $number;
  }
}

//print result
echo "The sum of the numbers is: $sum\n";
echo "The maximum number is: $max\n";
echo "The minimum number is: $min\n";
echo "The average is: $average\n";
echo "The even numbers are: " . implode(", ", $evenNumbers) . "\n";
echo "The odd numbers are: " . implode(", ", $oddNumbers) . "\n";
?>

Output:
Enter the numbers with a comma: 1,2,3,4,5
The sum of the numbers is: 15
The maximum number is: 5
The minimum number is: 1
The average is: 3
The even numbers are: 2, 4
The odd numbers are: 1, 3, 5
