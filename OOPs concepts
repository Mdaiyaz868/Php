You need to write a PHP program by using OOPs concepts to check if a person is eligible to vote or not. Condition: 
 • Minimum age required for vote is 18. ( take it as data member of the class)
 • You can use PHP Functions. ( Create a PHP function for the logic) 
 • You can use Decision Making Statements. ( control statement)
Code:
<?php
class Voter {
    public $min_age = 18;
    public function isEligibleToVote($age) {
        return $age >= $this->min_age;
    }
}
$voter = new Voter();
$age = 19;
if ($voter->isEligibleToVote($age)) {
    echo "You are eligible to vote.";
} else {
    echo "You are not eligible to vote.";
}
?>

Output:
You are eligible to vote.
