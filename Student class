Question Description: You are tasked with creating a PHP class called Student to represent information about a student. The Student class should have the following attributes and methods: Attributes:
 • firstName (string) - The first name of the student.
 • lastName (string) - The last name of the student.
 • age (int) - The age of the student.
 • email (string) - The email address of the student. Methods: 
 • __construct() - A constructor method that takes parameters for firstName, lastName, age, and email and initializes the corresponding attributes.
 • getFullName() - A method that returns the full name of the student (e.g., "John Doe").
 • isTeenager() - A method that returns true if the student's age is between 13 and 19 (inclusive), indicating that the student is a teenager.
 • sendEmail($subject, $message) - A method that simulates sending an email to the student. It should take two parameters: $subject (string) and $message (string). 
This method should display a message like "Email sent to [student's email] with subject: [subject]" 
where [student's email] and [subject] are placeholders for the actual email address and subject. Instructions:
 • Create the Student class with the specified attributes and methods.
 • Test your Student class by creating several Student objects and demonstrating the use of its methods. 
 • Ensure that the methods are working correctly and that the class follows good OOP practices.
Code:
<?php
class Student {
    private $firstName;
    private $lastName;
    private $age;
    private $email;
    public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age, $email) {
        $this->firstName = $firstName;
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
        $this->age = $age;
        $this->email = $email;
    }
    public function getFullName() {
        return $this->firstName . ' ' . $this->lastName;
    }
    public function isTeenager() {
        return ($this->age >= 13 && $this->age <= 19);
    }
    public function sendEmail($subject, $message) {
        echo "Email sent to {$this->email} with subject: $subject\n";
    }
}
$firstName = readline("Enter first name: ");
$lastName = readline("Enter last name: ");
$age = intval(readline("Enter age: "));
$email = readline("Enter email: ");
$student1 = new Student($firstName, $lastName, $age, $email);
echo $student1->getFullName();
if ($student1->isTeenager()) {
    echo " This student is a teenager.\n";
} else {
    echo " This student is not a teenager.\n";
}
$subject = readline("Enter email subject: ");
$message = readline("Enter email message: ");
$student1->sendEmail($subject, $message);
?>

Output:
Enter first name:Md
