Question Description: Create a PHP class for a "Product" with the following attributes and methods:
 Attributes: • Name: The name of the product (string).
 • Price: The price of the product (float). 
 • Quantity: The quantity of the product in stock (integer). Methods:
 • __construct(): A constructor method that initializes the product with a name, price, and quantity.
 • getInfo(): A method that returns a string containing the product's name, price, and quantity in the format: "Product: [Name], Price: $[Price], Quantity: [Quantity]".
 • buy(): A method that allows purchasing a certain quantity of the product. It should decrease the quantity in stock by the specified amount. 
 • restock(): A method that allows adding a certain quantity of the product to the stock. It should increase the quantity in stock by the specified amount.
 Note: You should also include appropriate data validation, such as ensuring that the price and quantity are non-negative numbers.
 //Driver Code $product = new Product("Widget", 19.99, 100); 
// Output: "Product: Widget, Price: $19.99, Quantity: 100" echo $product->getInfo(); $product->buy(20);
// Output: "Product: Widget, Price: $19.99, Quantity: 80" echo $product->getInfo(); $product->restock(50);
// Output: "Product: Widget, Price: $19.99, Quantity: 130" echo $product->getInfo();
Code
<?php
class Product {
    private $name;
    private $price;
    private $quantity;

    public function __construct($name, $price, $quantity) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->price = max(0, $price);
        $this->quantity = max(0, $quantity);
    }
    public function getInfo() {
        return "Product: {$this->name}, Price: \$ {$this->price}, Quantity: {$this->quantity}";
    }
    public function buy($amount) {
        if ($amount > 0 && $amount <= $this->quantity) {
            $this->quantity -= $amount;
        }
    }
    public function restock($amount) {
        if ($amount > 0) {
            $this->quantity += $amount;
        }
    }
}
$name = readline("Enter product name: ");
$price = floatval(readline("Enter product price: "));
$quantity = intval(readline("Enter product quantity: "));
$product = new Product($name, $price, $quantity);
echo $product->getInfo();
$buyAmount = intval(readline("\n Enter quantity to buy:  "));
$product->buy($buyAmount);
echo $product->getInfo();
$restockAmount = intval(readline("\n Enter quantity to restock: "));
$product->restock($restockAmount);
echo $product->getInfo();
?>

Output:
Enter product name: Aiyaz
Enter product price: 456
Enter product quantity: 45
Product: Aiyaz, Price: $ 456, $ Quantity: 45 Enter quantity to buy:23
Product: Aiyaz, Price: $ 456, $ Quantity: 22 Enter quantity to restock:8
Product: Aiyaz, Price: $ 456, $ Quantity: 30
